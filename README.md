# Computer Vision Landmark Detection and Tracking(SLAM)

## Description

This project is the second project of the _Deep Learning nanodegree_, schooled by **Udacity, Inc.** ([https://eu.udacity.com](https://eu.udacity.com/)), a for-profit educational organization offering massive open online courses.

The project objective is to implement the SLAM algorithm in a 2D environment in order to learn and simulate how object location and tracking is done in robotic motion.

In this repository, you will find the following files and folders:

-   The file  _**1_Robot_Moving_and_Sensing.ipynb**_, the Jupyter Notebook contains all the code used to create the robot object;
-   The file  _**3_Landmark_Detection_and_Tracking.ipynb**_, the Jupyter Notebook contains all the code used to implement the Graph SLAM Algorithm;
-   The file  _robot_class.py_, contains the robot object architecture;
